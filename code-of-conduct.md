## Code of Conduct for Cutler Running Club Members

The Member Code of Conduct is created for the safety and benefit of the Cutler Running Club, and its members and guests.
The purpose of this policy is to set forth the basic principles of decency we expect members to follow so that members can achieve their running goals in a safe environment.

As a member of Cutler Running Club, you agree to:

1. Observe and obey all rules and regulations governing races including those governing the transfer of bibs and pacing.
Engage in fair competition which includes anti-doping compliance, no course cutting, or other means of gaining a competitive advantage that is considered cheating when participating races where you may represent the club by wearing a club uniform.
2. Each member is a representative of Cutler Running Club; be mindful of your actions in public places, at events, and during training runs, as they may reflect on, and have negative consequences for Cutler Running Club as an organization.
3. Always show respect for your fellow club members at all times.
4. Always show respect and appreciation for the volunteers who give their time to help the club and / or event(s).
5. Act with honesty and integrity.
6. Never yell, taunt, or threaten physical violence upon another member of the club, a volunteer or event spectator.
Members with a criminal history of violence or with a legal restraining order against them by another member may be barred from membership and participation in all club activities.
7. Never use abusive or vulgar language, or make racial, ethnic, religious or gender-related slurs or derogatory comments at club events.
8. Never make unwanted physical contact with other members.
9. Never use or share alcohol with members at club / group runs.

12. Look after the other runners within your training group; if someone is struggling, inform your run leader and make sure that they are not left on their own.
13. Use of headphones during group runs is discouraged for the safety of you and those around you; if you feel compelled to wear headphones during a group run, either use them at a low volume or only use in one ear to be able to hear what is going on around you.
Please be courteous to your fellow runners and group leader by being alert and involved.
14. Show your appreciation to event organizers, race management, timers, volunteers, fans, etc.
If you had a bad experience, keep your comments to your personal online accounts as to not impose your opinions as the "club's" opinion.
15. Report violations of the Member Code of Conduct or race rules to the Cutler Running Club board in written communication.
The board shall be responsible for verifying all the complaints.
If verified, the disciplinary measure to the accused person(s) shall be implemented.
